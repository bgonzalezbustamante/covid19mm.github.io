# Mobility Data

Mobility data is provided by Cuebiq, a location intelligence and measurement platform. Through its Data for Good program, Cuebiq provides access to aggregated and privacy-safe mobility data for academic research and humanitarian initiatives. This first-party data is collected from anonymized users who have opted-in to provide access to their location data anonymously, through a GDPR-compliant framework.

# Mobility metrics

By aggregating mobility data on a daily and weekly basis, we compute mobility metrics can provide insights into the changes induced by travel restrictions.

We compute:
* Origin-Destination matrices at province level
* Average and median users' radius of gyration at province level
* A daily proximity network of users at the province level
